	<h2>Media Queries</h2>
	<p>To briefly cover media queries, there are many browser types which may need to be catered to. For instance, we may want to style based on media="print" or media="tv", 
	which basically means we style for print or tv. We also may want to style based on screen size or resolution:</p>
	<p>ex:</p>
		<ul><li>@media screen and (max-width: 400px;){style} </li></ul>
	<p>ex 2:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>@media (orientation:portrait){.style {height:1px;}}</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This example will only style for a screen with a set max width.</p>
	<p> In this case, if the screen is a mini-computer, net book or mobile device then the stylesheet will display.
	If not the style will be ignored. That being said it wouldn't be a good idea to fragment the stylesheet. Modern mobile devices respond to screen along with all other browsers. 
	Specificity may come into play in optimizing for smaller screens or much larger screen, even tv's with web browsers built into them and gaming. However, best 
	practices suggest keeping code small and developing with a project in mind that will serve the intended purpose while keeping in mind the many browsers that may be displaying
	the site or app.</p>
